Here’s an explanation of the listed Java concepts:

---

### **Class**
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and methods (functions) that objects of the class can use.

Example :
// Define the Car class
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;

    // Method to drive the car
    void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
    }
}

// Main class to call the Car class and its methods
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance (object) of Car class
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Set values for the properties (brand and speed)
        myCar.brand = "Toyota";  // Set the brand
        myCar.speed = 100;       // Set the speed

        // Call the drive method
        myCar.drive();  // Output: Toyota is driving at 100 km/h.
    }
}


---

### **Object**
An **object** is an instance of a class. It holds data and can perform operations defined in its class.

Example:
```java
Car car1 = new Car();
car1.brand = "Toyota";
car1.speed = 120;
car1.drive();
```

---

### **Data Types**
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold.

- **Primitive Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Arrays, Strings, Classes, etc.

Example:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "John";
```

---

### **Properties**
Properties are variables defined within a class, also called fields or attributes.

Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
}
```

---

### **Methods**
Methods are functions inside a class that define behaviors or operations for objects.

Example:
```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

---

### **Static**
The `static` keyword makes a member belong to the class rather than an instance. You can access static members without creating an object.

Example:
```java
class Utility {
    static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
}
System.out.println(Utility.square(5)); // Outputs 25
```

---

### **Constructor**
### **Constructor in Java (Short Explanation)**

A **constructor** in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and is called when an object of the class is created. A constructor does not have a return type.

### Types of Constructors:
1. **Default Constructor**: A constructor without parameters. If not defined, Java provides one automatically.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor with parameters, used to initialize objects with specific values.

### **Example**:

```java
// Car class with a constructor
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;

    // Default Constructor
    Car() {
        brand = "Unknown";
        speed = 0;
        System.out.println("Default Constructor Called.");
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Car(String brand, int speed) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = speed;
        System.out.println("Parameterized Constructor Called.");
    }

    // Method to drive the car
    void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the Default Constructor

        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.drive();  // Output: Unknown is driving at 0 km/h.

        // Using the Parameterized Constructor
        Car car2 = new Car("Toyota", 120);
        car2.drive();  // Output: Toyota is driving at 120 km/h.
    }
}
```

### **Output**:
```plaintext
Default Constructor Called.
Unknown is driving at 0 km/h.
Parameterized Constructor Called.
Toyota is driving at 120 km/h.
```

### **Key Points**:
- **Default Constructor**: If no constructor is defined, Java provides one. It initializes the object with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Used to initialize an object with specific values passed during object creation.

---

### **This Keyword**
`this` refers to the current object instance. It is often used to differentiate instance variables from parameters.

Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

---

### **Inheritance**
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```
In Java, inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class. The class that is inherited from is called the parent class (or superclass), and the class that inherits is called the child class (or subclass).

There are different types of inheritance in Java. Below is the explanation and classification:

Types of Inheritance in Java:
Single Inheritance:

In single inheritance, a child class can inherit from only one parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance.
Example: A child class inherits from a single parent class.


Multilevel Inheritance:

In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a class that is also derived from another class.

Hierarchical Inheritance:

In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

Multiple Inheritance (Not Supported in Java):

In multiple inheritance, a class inherits from more than one class. However, Java does not support multiple inheritance directly, as it can lead to ambiguity (e.g., if two parent classes have the same method).
Java achieves multiple inheritance through interfaces

Hybrid Inheritance (Combining Types):

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can include a mix of single, multilevel, hierarchical, and interface inheritance. However, Java doesn’t support hybrid inheritance directly due to the ambiguity it may introduce (it only supports hybrid inheritance through interfaces)..
---

### **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object.

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

- **Compile-time (Method Overloading)**:
```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

- **Runtime (Method Overriding)**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

Method Overloading in Java
Method Overloading occurs when a class has more than one method with the same name, but they differ in the number of parameters or the type of parameters. The return type can be the same or different, but it is not a factor in method overloading.

Rules for Method Overloading:
The method name must be the same.
The number of parameters must be different, or the types of parameters must be different (or both).
The return type may or may not be different.
The method signature (method name + parameter types) must be unique.
```

---

### **Super**
The `super` keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call a superclass constructor or method.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // Calls Animal's sound method
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}
```
The super Keyword in Java
The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class (superclass) of the current object. It has several uses, primarily to:

Access Parent Class Methods: You can call a method of the parent class that has been overridden in the child class.
Access Parent Class Constructor: It is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
Access Parent Class Fields: You can access the fields (variables) of the parent class if they are hidden by the child class.
---

### **Abstraction**
Abstraction hides implementation details and only shows essential features. It is achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.

- **Abstract Class**:
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Interface**
An interface is a blueprint for a class with only method declarations. A class implements an interface.

Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

### **Interface in Java** - **Summary**

An **interface** in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, but it can only contain method signatures (abstract methods), constants (variables), default methods, static methods, and private methods. Interfaces define a contract for classes that implement them. Here's a concise breakdown of key points:

### 1. **Defining an Interface**:
   - Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword.
   - An interface can contain **abstract methods** (without a body) and **default/static methods** (with a body).

   ```java
   interface Animal {
       // Abstract method (no body)
       void sound();

       // Default method with a body
       default void breathe() {
           System.out.println("Breathing...");
       }

       // Static method with a body
       static void sleep() {
           System.out.println("Animal is sleeping.");
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Implementation**:
   - A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword.
   - The class **must** provide implementations for all abstract methods of the interface unless the class is abstract.

   ```java
   class Dog implements Animal {
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Bark");
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Key Features**:
   - **Methods**:
     - **Abstract methods**: Methods declared in the interface without a body (implicitly `public` and `abstract`).
     - **Default methods**: Methods with a body, introduced in Java 8. Can be used directly by classes that implement the interface.
     - **Static methods**: Methods with a body, introduced in Java 8. These methods belong to the interface, not to the class implementing it.
     - **Private methods**: Methods with a body, introduced in Java 9, that can only be used within the interface itself.

   - **Variables**:
     - All variables in an interface are **implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`** (i.e., constants).

   ```java
   interface Animal {
       int LEGS = 4;  // final, static, public by default
   }
   ```

   - **No Constructors**: Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated directly.

### 4. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - A class can implement **multiple interfaces**, which allows Java to support multiple inheritance of type (but not implementation).

   ```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

interface Pet {
    void play();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Pet {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of Dog
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        // Calling methods from both interfaces
        dog.sound();  // From Animal interface
        dog.play();   // From Pet interface
    }
}


### 5. **Access Modifiers**:
   - All methods in an interface are **implicitly `public`**.
   - Interface variables are **implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`**.

### 6. **Interface vs Abstract Class**:
   - **Interface**: Cannot have instance variables or constructors, and all methods are either abstract or have a body (default/static methods).
   - **Abstract Class**: Can have instance variables, constructors, and both abstract and non-abstract methods.

### 7. **Marker Interface**:
   - An interface with no methods, used to mark a class for a specific behavior. Example: `Serializable`.

   ```java
   interface Serializable {
       // No methods
   }
   ```

### 8. **Example**:
   ```java
   interface Animal {
       void sound();  // Abstract method
       default void breathe() {
           System.out.println("Breathing...");
       }
   }

   class Dog implements Animal {
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Bark");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog dog = new Dog();
           dog.sound();  // Calls Dog's implemented method
           dog.breathe();  // Calls Animal's default method
           Animal.sleep();  // Calls Animal's static method
       }
   }
   ```

### **Output**:
```plaintext
Bark
Breathing...
Animal is sleeping.
```

### **Summary**:
- **Interface** defines a contract with abstract methods (and can have default/static methods).
- **Class** implements the interface and provides implementations for its methods.
- Interface variables are **`public`, `static`, and `final`** by default.
- Supports **multiple inheritance** (classes can implement multiple interfaces).
- Cannot have **constructors** or **instance variables**.

Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these points!

### **Package**
A package organizes classes and interfaces into namespaces, improving code modularity.

Example:
```java
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a package example.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Access Specifiers**
Access specifiers control the visibility of class members:
- **Public**: Accessible everywhere.
- **Protected**: Accessible in the same package or subclasses.
- **Default (No Modifier)**: Accessible in the same package.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class.

Example:
```java
class Example {
    private int data; // Accessible only within this class
    public int id;    // Accessible everywhere
}
```

Encapsulation in Java - Overview
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, alongside Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It refers to the practice of bundling or grouping related variables (properties/fields) and methods (functions) together in a class and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is done to protect the object's state by preventing unauthorized or unintended access and modification.

Key Features of Encapsulation:
Private Data: The object's internal state (instance variables) is usually declared private, meaning they cannot be directly accessed from outside the class.
Public Methods: Public methods (often called getters and setters) provide controlled access to these private variables.
Control Access: By using getter and setter methods, you can control how and when the variables are modified or accessed. For example, you can validate the data before setting it.

class Person {
    // Private variables (fields) that cannot be directly accessed from outside the class
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor to initialize the fields
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter method for 'name'
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method for 'name'
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method for 'age'
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter method for 'age' with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0 && age < 150) {  // Age must be a positive number and less than 150
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Person class
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 25);

        // Accessing the private fields using getter methods
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + person.getAge());

        // Modifying the private fields using setter methods
        person.setName("Bob");
        person.setAge(30);

        // Displaying updated values
        System.out.println("Updated Name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Updated Age: " + person.getAge());

        // Trying to set an invalid age
        person.setAge(200);  // Invalid age
    }
}
Explanation:
Private Variables: The name and age fields are private, so they cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
Public Methods: The getName() and getAge() methods provide controlled access to the private fields.
The setter method setAge() includes a validation check to ensure the age is reasonable (between 0 and 150). If an invalid value is passed, an error message is printed.
Summary of Encapsulation:
Private Variables: Prevents unauthorized access to object data.
Public Methods: Provide controlled access to private data.
Getter and Setter Methods: Encapsulate the internal state and add data validation or manipulation logic.
Benefits: Helps in protecting the integrity of the object’s state, improves maintainability, and enhances security.

### **Exception and Exception Handling**
An **exception** is an unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. **Exception handling** ensures graceful error handling using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`.

Example:
```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Execution completed.");
}
```

### **Error and Exception Handling in Java**

In Java, errors and exceptions are mechanisms used to handle runtime anomalies or issues that can occur during the execution of a program. Proper handling of these ensures the program behaves more predictably and prevents abrupt termination.

### **1. Errors**:
- **Errors** are severe issues that generally cannot be recovered from and are usually caused by the environment (like the JVM or hardware).
- Examples: **OutOfMemoryError**, **StackOverflowError**, **VirtualMachineError**.
- Errors are **not** meant to be caught by code (no need to handle them explicitly with `try-catch` blocks).

### **2. Exceptions**:
- **Exceptions** are events that disrupt the normal flow of execution, usually caused by logical or input/output issues, like division by zero, null pointer access, etc.
- **Exceptions** are further divided into:
  - **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared to be thrown using `throws`. Example: `IOException`, `SQLException`.
  - **Unchecked Exceptions** (Runtime Exceptions): These exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or declared. They are usually caused by programming errors like `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### **3. Try-Catch Block**:
- A **`try-catch`** block is used to handle exceptions. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the handling of the exception is done in the `catch` block.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handler
    System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### **4. Finally Block**:
- The **`finally`** block is used to execute code after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. It's usually used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Handle exception
} finally {
    // Code that will always be executed
    System.out.println("This is always executed.");
}
```

### **5. Throwing Exceptions**:
- You can **throw** exceptions manually using the `throw` keyword. This is used to indicate that something went wrong in the method or class, and it can be either a checked or unchecked exception.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
throw new ExceptionType("Custom exception message");
```

### **6. Throws Keyword**:
- The `throws` keyword is used in the method signature to declare that a method can throw one or more exceptions, enabling the caller of the method to handle them.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
public void myMethod() throws IOException {
    // Code that may throw an IOException
}
```

### **Example: Basic Exception Handling**:
```java
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Code that may throw an exception
            int result = 10 / 0;  // Division by zero
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            // Catching the exception and handling it
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
        } finally {
            // This will always be executed
            System.out.println("This is the finally block.");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Output**:
```plaintext
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
This is the finally block.
```

### **7. Custom Exceptions**:
- You can define your own exception classes by extending the `Exception` class or `RuntimeException` class (for unchecked exceptions).

#### **Example of Custom Exception**:
```java
// Define a custom exception class
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(16);  // This will throw an InvalidAgeException
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### **Output**:
```plaintext
Caught exception: Age must be 18 or above
```

### **Key Points**:
1. **Error**: Severe issues that usually cannot be recovered from (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`).
2. **Exception**: Issues that can be handled by the program, split into:
   - **Checked exceptions** (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`).
   - **Unchecked exceptions** (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`).
3. **Try-Catch**: Used to catch and handle exceptions. The code that may throw an exception is in the `try` block, and the exception handling is in the `catch` block..

4. **Finally**: Block executed after `try` and `catch` to ensure cleanup actions are performed.
5. **Throw and Throws**: Use `throw` to throw exceptions manually and `throws` to declare exceptions in method signatures.

Exception handling is essential for creating robust applications, ensuring they continue to operate smoothly even when unforeseen issues arise.
